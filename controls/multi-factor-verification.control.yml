version: 1.0.0
name: Multi-Factor Verification Control
description: |
  Implements multi-layered identity verification combining multiple independent
  verification methods including document verification, biometric authentication,
  knowledge-based authentication, and database cross-checks. This control ensures
  high confidence in customer identity before granting access or opening accounts.

implementation:
  method: system
  technology:
    - Biometric authentication (facial recognition, fingerprint)
    - OCR and AI document verification
    - Knowledge-based authentication (KBA)
    - Database verification (credit bureaus, government databases)
    - Liveness detection
    - Sanctions screening APIs

  procedure: |
    Multi-Factor Verification Process:

    1. Document Verification Layer:
       - Capture and analyze government-issued ID
       - Verify document authenticity using AI/ML models
       - Extract and validate document data
       - Check for tampering or forgery indicators

    2. Biometric Verification Layer:
       - Capture live biometric data (facial recognition or fingerprint)
       - Perform liveness detection to prevent spoofing
       - Compare biometric against ID photo
       - Calculate biometric match confidence score

    3. Knowledge-Based Authentication:
       - Present questions based on customer history
       - Verify responses against trusted data sources
       - Calculate KBA confidence score

    4. Database Cross-Checks:
       - Verify identity against credit bureau records
       - Check government databases where permitted
       - Cross-reference address and employment history
       - Verify phone number and email ownership

    5. Sanctions and Watchlist Screening:
       - Screen against OFAC, EU, UN sanctions lists
       - Check PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) databases
       - Screen against internal fraud databases
       - Check adverse media sources

    6. Risk Scoring:
       - Aggregate all verification factors
       - Calculate overall confidence score
       - Apply risk-based decision rules
       - Route to manual review if threshold not met

    Thresholds:
    - Auto-approve: Overall confidence >= 85%
    - Manual review: 70% <= confidence < 85%
    - Auto-reject: confidence < 70%
